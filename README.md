A simple chat program made in C. I made it to test out sockets. Linux only, atleast for now.

to build I use gcc. "gcc server.c -o server; gcc client.c -o client"

client can take command line argument for ipv4 address to connect to. eg. "./client 192.168.1.2"

I expect noneone to ever use this for anything and thusly I have no plans of making this into an actually good chat program or trying to squish bugs.
